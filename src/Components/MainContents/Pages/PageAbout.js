      <h2>Howdy! Everyone you seen this</h2>
      <a>I'm Sitouthay Xayalat or you can call me Jackie as a english. I'm a web developer that thrives on bringing ideas to life with code!</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <a>I advocate for creative coding giving you the confidence to build anything imaginable. I enjoy speaking about this and showing people how to level up their skills.</a>

      <a>I'm known for my whimsical creations and ability to solve complex problems. This led to me getting branded as somewhat of a polyglot coder. It's incredible to me that you can open a computer and learn about anything at your fingertips!</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <a>I've been fortunate to work with and for names such as Google, Uber, Nike, and Monzo. I'm currently a Developer Relations Engineer at Google where I work on the web platform.</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <a>I also create a lot of demos. And I mean, a lot. I've created well over 1500 demos on CodePen, featuring on the "Most Hearted" many times. As for code; I like to dig in with React, architect CSS in or out of JavaScript, animate with GSAP, and nerd out in Node. I've got a track record of delivering eye-catching results ahead of schedule. All whilst possessing a keen eye for design, accessibility, performance, and well-structured code.</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <a>Besides demos, I love to create videos, stream, write articles, and speak at conferences. Check out the "Content" tab for more on that.</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <a>Reach out and say "Hey!". I look forward to hearing from you!</a>
